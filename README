Padre-Plugin-Filter
===================

This plug-in enables the use of Unix-like external filtering 
commands/scripts to transform part or all of the current document.

The output of the filter can either replace the input, be appended to 
the input, or be inserted into a new document.

Unlike Unix filters, the filter mechanism in this plug-in 
is designed to use input and output files rather than STDIN and STDOUT.
